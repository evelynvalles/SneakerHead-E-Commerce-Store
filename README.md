# SneakerHead

## Description

Shoe e-commerce website built using React, JavaScript, Commerce.js, Stripe API, React-Hook-Form, Material UI, and CSS. This project was created by myself
in a one-week sprint.

The inspiration behind this project was behind my love for shopping and and admiration for modern e-commerce websites using single-page software and tools. 

The challenges I overcame were thoroughly understanding Comemerce.js's API documentation, learning Material UI from scratch, and programming the checkout
process on my own. Overall, I am happy with new development experience, and I am excited to continue building more e-commerce projects in the months to come.
